Some people even avoid using it when possible! Here are a few reasons why people believe this:</p>
<p>There are 13 people at the Last Supper - Jesus and his 12 disciples.</p>
<p>The Knights Templar were arrested on Friday, October 13, 1307.</p>
<p>There are 13 stripes on the American flag.</p>
<p>Friday the 13th is considered an unlucky day.</p>
<p>Many hotels do not have a room numbered 13.</p>
<p>So if you want to avoid bad luck, try to avoid using the number 13!</p>
<h1 id="Opt-for-lucky-numbers-instead-to-give-yourself-the-best-chance-of-winning"><a href="#Opt-for-lucky-numbers-instead-to-give-yourself-the-best-chance-of-winning" class="headerlink" title="Opt for lucky numbers instead to give yourself the best chance of winning!"></a>Opt for lucky numbers instead to give yourself the best chance of winning!</h1><p>There are numerous ways in which you can give yourself the best chance of winning when playing games of chance, but using lucky numbers is one strategy that many people swear by. So, if you want to give yourself the best possible chance of winning when playing games such as bingo, lottery or even casino games, then here are some tips on how to choose your lucky numbers.</p>
<p>When it comes to choosing your lucky numbers, there is no set formula – it’s all down to personal preference. However, there are some general tips that you may find helpful when trying to pick your lucky numbers. Firstly, it’s often said that you should use your date of birth or important dates in your life as your lucky numbers. You could also use numbers that are significant to you in some other way, such as those that have featured in significant lottery wins in the past.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider when picking your lucky numbers is the number sequence. Many people believe that certain sequences of numbers are luckier than others. For example, many people favour the number sequence 1-2-3-4-5-6 over other sequences. Alternatively, if you prefer a more random approach then you could opt for a number generator to pick your lucky numbers for you.</p>
<p>Whichever method you choose, using lucky numbers is one simple way to give yourself the best chance of winning when playing games of chance. So why not try it out for yourself and see if it makes a difference?</p>

However, some numbers are definitely more likely to come up than others, so it’s worth increasing your chances by playing these.</p>
<p>The most commonly drawn numbers in both bingo and roulette are 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, and 13. So if you want to give yourself the best chance of winning, it’s worth betting on these.</p>
<p>However, you shouldn’t just stick to these numbers – experiment with a few different combinations to see which ones work best for you. And remember, even if you don’t hit the jackpot straight away, there’s always next time!</p>
