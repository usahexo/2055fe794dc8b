            <h1 id="Canada’s-Top-Poker-Sites-Introduce-Rake-Free-Games"><a href="#Canada’s-Top-Poker-Sites-Introduce-Rake-Free-Games" class="headerlink" title="Canada’s Top Poker Sites Introduce Rake-Free Games"></a>Canada’s Top Poker Sites Introduce Rake-Free Games</h1><p>Online poker players in Canada can rejoice as the top Canadian poker sites have all introduced rake-free games.</p>
<p>PokerStars, partypoker, 888poker, and other leading poker sites now offer a variety of rake-free games that are perfect for recreational players. These games offer a casual gaming experience with no added costs.</p>
<p>Rake is the amount of money taken by the poker site from each hand as a fee for hosting the game. This money goes towards maintaining the site and paying staff salaries. Rake-free games remove this cost, making it easier for players to enjoy a casual game without worrying about spending extra money.</p>
<p>Players can now enjoy a wide range of rake-free games at Canada’s top poker sites. These include Texas Hold’em, Omaha, and 7-Card Stud in both cash game and tournament formats. In addition, Sit &amp; Go tournaments are also available rake-free, making it easy for players to get in a quick game without having to worry about fees.</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2018, partypoker has offered over $2 million in rake-free prize pools each month. This number is expected to grow as more players take advantage of these games. Players can join in on the fun by downloading partypoker and enjoying some of the best rake-free games available anywhere online.</p>
<h1 id="PartyPoker-Announces-All-NL-Hold’em-and-Omaha-Cash-Games-Are-rake-free"><a href="#PartyPoker-Announces-All-NL-Hold’em-and-Omaha-Cash-Games-Are-rake-free" class="headerlink" title="PartyPoker Announces All NL Hold’em and Omaha Cash Games Are rake-free"></a>PartyPoker Announces All NL Hold’em and Omaha Cash Games Are rake-free</h1><h1 id="For-One-Week-Only"><a href="#For-One-Week-Only" class="headerlink" title="For One Week Only"></a>For One Week Only</h1><p>PartyPoker has announced that all NL Hold’em and Omaha cash games will be rake-free for one week only. This promotion begins on Monday, May 7th at 00:01 GMT and ends on Sunday, May 13th at 23:59 GMT.</p>
<p>Players can take advantage of this promotion by joining any of the following cash games: </p>
<p>NL Hold’em - $0.01&#x2F;$0.02 up to $25&#x2F;$50<br>PL Omaha - $0.01&#x2F;$0.02 up to $25&#x2F;$50<br>FL Omaha Hi&#x2F;Lo - $0.01&#x2F;$0.02 up to $25&#x2F;$50<br>Omaha Pot Limit - $0.01&#x2F;$0.02 up to $25&#x2F;$50<br>Texas Hold’em - $0.01&#x2F;$0.02 up to $5&#x2F;$10<br>7 Card Stud - $0.01&#x2F;$0.02 up to $2&#x2F;$4<br>5 Card Stud - $0.01&#x2F;$0.02 up to $1&#x2F;$2</p>
<h1 id="PokerStars-Eliminates-Rake-from-All-NL-Heads-Up-Cash-Games"><a href="#PokerStars-Eliminates-Rake-from-All-NL-Heads-Up-Cash-Games" class="headerlink" title="PokerStars Eliminates Rake from All NL Heads-Up Cash Games"></a>PokerStars Eliminates Rake from All NL Heads-Up Cash Games</h1><p>In a surprising announcement yesterday, PokerStars eliminated rake from all heads-up No Limit cash games. The change is effective immediately and will apply to all tables, including high stakes games.</p>
<p>The decision was made in an effort to improve the poker experience for players and encourage more recreational players to give the game a try. In a statement, PokerStars said “We believe that this move will make playing heads-up No Limit cash games even more attractive and enjoyable for our customers.”</p>
<p>One of the most common complaints among poker players is the feeling that they are being taken advantage of by the rake. By eliminating rake from heads-up games, PokerStars has effectively removed one of the biggest deterrents for recreational players. It will be interesting to see if this results in an increase in traffic on the site’s heads-up cash games.</p>
<p>In addition to eliminating rake, PokerStars also announced a new rewards program for heads-up cash game players. Under the new program, players will earn points based on the number of hands they play, rather than their buy-in amount. These points can be redeemed for merchandise or tournament entries.</p>
<p>The changes mark a significant shift in strategy for PokerStars, which has traditionally relied on high rake rates to generate revenue. With industry leader Full Tilt Poker shutting down last year and its parent company indicted by the US government, PokerStars is under pressure to find new ways to boost its bottom line.</p>
<p>Regardless of the motivation behind it, this latest move by PokerStars is sure to be welcomed by players everywhere.</p>
<h1 id="GreySnowPoker-Becomes-Second-Canadian-Site-to-Go-rake-free"><a href="#GreySnowPoker-Becomes-Second-Canadian-Site-to-Go-rake-free" class="headerlink" title="GreySnowPoker Becomes Second Canadian Site to Go rake-free"></a>GreySnowPoker Becomes Second Canadian Site to Go rake-free</h1><p>This week, GreySnowPoker.com announced that it will become the second rake-free Canadian poker site.</p>
<p>The decision comes just months after Quebec’s Winamax became the first Canadian site to forego rake in favour of a monthly membership fee.</p>
<p>“It is a great time to be a poker player in Canada,” said GreySnowPoker spokesperson Darren Weir in a statement.</p>
<p>“With more and more sites becoming rake-free, Canadian players have more options than ever before when it comes to playing the game they love.”</p>
<p>GreySnowPoker joins an ever-growing list of rake-free online poker sites that includes PokerStars, partypoker, 888poker, and PokerGo.</p>
<p>While the reasons for going rake-free vary from site to site, most operators say that it is a way of attracting new players and retaining existing ones.</p>
<p>Some sites also see rake-free gaming as a way of differentiating themselves from their competitors.</p>
<h1 id="Winamax-Moves-to-No-Rake-on-All-its-NLHE-Cash-Tables"><a href="#Winamax-Moves-to-No-Rake-on-All-its-NLHE-Cash-Tables" class="headerlink" title="Winamax Moves to No Rake on All its NLHE Cash Tables"></a>Winamax Moves to No Rake on All its NLHE Cash Tables</h1><p>Following in the footsteps of Pokerstars, Winamax has announced that it will be instituting no rake on all its NLHE cash tables as of September 1st.</p>
<p>The decision is part of a wider strategy by Winamax to become the preeminent online poker room for French-speaking players. The site has been offering a wide range of promotions lately, including a “reload bonus” worth up to €100 and a €10,000 prize pool for its monthly Sunday tournament.</p>
<p>Winamax also offers a wide variety of games, including Omaha, Stud and HORSE. Its software is widely considered to be one of the best in the business, thanks in part to its built-in hand history viewer and extensive filters.</p>
<p>The no rake announcement comes just days after Partypoker announced that it would be eliminating rake from all its NLHE cash games starting on September 1st. That move is seen as an attempt by Partypoker to attract recreational players and mitigate the impact of new regulations in Spain that restrict the number of tables that can be open at any given time.</p>
