            <h1 id="The-future-of-online-gambling-is-esports"><a href="#The-future-of-online-gambling-is-esports" class="headerlink" title="The future of online gambling is esports"></a>The future of online gambling is esports</h1><p>Over the past few years, esports has exploded in popularity, with millions of people watching professional gamers compete in everything from League of Legends to Fortnite. Esports is now a multi-billion dollar industry, and it shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>This is great news for the world of online gambling. Esports offers a huge potential audience for online casinos, and as the industry grows, we can expect to see even more betting options being offered on esports matches.</p>
<p>One reason for the growth of esports is that it’s an incredibly exciting form of entertainment. Viewers can watch skilled players execute amazing maneuvers and pull off miraculous comebacks, all while betting on the outcome of the match. This makes for an incredibly immersive experience that’s impossible to replicate with traditional sports.</p>
<p>Another reason for the rise of esports is that it’s a very accessible form of entertainment. You don’t need to be a expert at football or basketball to enjoy watching a competitive game of FIFA or LoL. In fact, many people who have never even played video games before are now avid fans of esports.</p>
<p>This accessibility is also great news for online casinos. By offering betting options on esports matches, casinos can appeal to a whole new audience that might not normally gamble online. And since many people who enjoy watching esports also enjoy betting on games, this presents a huge opportunity for casinos to boost their profits.</p>
<p>As the world of esports continues to grow, we can expect to see even more excitement and innovation in the online gambling industry. Who knows – maybe one day you’ll be able to bet on professional gamers competing in VR tournaments!</p>
<h1 id="Esports-betting-is-the-new-black"><a href="#Esports-betting-is-the-new-black" class="headerlink" title="Esports betting is the new black"></a>Esports betting is the new black</h1><p>Esports betting, or the betting of virtual currency on esports matches, is becoming a popular way to make money. Esports is the term used to describe competitive gaming, typically involving professional gamers playing against each other in multimillion dollar tournaments.</p>
<p>As viewership of esports continues to grow, so does interest in betting on the outcomes of matches. Global spending on esports betting is expected to reach $12 billion by 2020, according to market research firmNewzoo. That’s up from an estimated $5.5 billion this year.</p>
<p>And the trend is being driven by millennials, who are driving the growth in both esports and sports betting overall. A recent study by Nielsen found that 43 percent of millennials are interested in gambling on sports, compared with only 29 percent of those over 35 years old.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for the growth in esports betting. For one thing, it’s easy to do. Fans can bet on matches through dedicated websites or apps, without having to leave their home or even get up from their chair.</p>
<p>What’s more, bets can be placed on a wide range of matches, making it possible to find something to bet on no matter what your interests are. Whether you’re into strategy games like League of Legends or first-person shooters like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, there’s likely a match you can bet on.</p>
<p>The liquidity of the gaming market also contributes to the popularity of esports betting. When games are streamed live online, fans can watch and bet on them at the same time, increasing the excitement and suspense of the competition. This helps explain why so many people are turning to esports betting as an alternative to traditional sports betting.</p>
<p>Not everyone agrees that Esports betting is a good thing though with some fearing addiction and unregulated gambling will become a huge issue — already some world leading economists have voiced concerns <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ft.com/content/2e6dd328-8aff-11e7-bce4-90b11c1aeb2d">https://www.ft.com/content/2e6dd328-8aff-11e7-bce4-90b11c1aeb2d</a>). However with continuous education and technology protection advances it looks very much like Esports Betting isn’t going anywhere soon! So whether you’re looking to make some extra cash or just want to add an extra level of excitement to watching your favorite esport - give Esports Betting a go!</p>
<h1 id="Rock-casino-announces-expansion-into-esports"><a href="#Rock-casino-announces-expansion-into-esports" class="headerlink" title="Rock casino announces expansion into esports"></a>Rock casino announces expansion into esports</h1><p>In a move that is sure to shake up the competitive gaming world, Rock casino has announced its intention to expand into the esports market.</p>
<p>The casino, which is already well-established in the online gambling sector, believes that there is huge potential in the growing field of professional gaming.</p>
<p>As part of its expansion plan, Rock casino has announced the launch of a new division, aptly named Rock Esports. The division will be responsible for organising and managing competitive gaming tournaments, as well as developing new games and content specifically for the esports market.</p>
<p>In addition, Rock Esports will also offer a range of services to players and teams, including talent management, marketing and sponsorship advice, and event organisation.</p>
<p>According to a spokesman for the casino, Rock Esports will be “a one-stop shop for all your esports needs”.</p>
<p>The launch of Rock Esports comes at a time when interest in competitive gaming is reaching fever pitch. Viewership of esports competitions is now estimated at over 380 million people worldwide, with this figure expected to grow significantly in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Industry analysts believe that the key to success in the burgeoning esports sector lies in engaging with fans and building strong relationships with sponsors and other partners. And it is this area where Rock Casino plans to make its mark.</p>
<p>“We are fully committed to making Rock Esports a success,” said the spokesman. “Our goal is to create a world-class organisation that will provide players with everything they need to compete at the highest level and fans with an unrivalled entertainment experience.”</p>
<h1 id="The-next-big-thing-in-gambling-Esports"><a href="#The-next-big-thing-in-gambling-Esports" class="headerlink" title="The next big thing in gambling? Esports"></a>The next big thing in gambling? Esports</h1><p>Esports is growing in popularity every day, and it’s no wonder why. This unique form of entertainment is a thrilling mix of video gaming and competitive sports. Not only is it great fun to watch, but playing in tournaments can also be extremely exciting.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Esports is here to stay. In fact, it’s already grown into a huge industry, with revenues expected to hit $1.5 billion by 2020. This is mainly due to the increasing number of people who are betting on Esports matches.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Esports yet, don’t worry – we’ll explain all you need to know in this article. We’ll also take a look at some of the top Esports betting sites out there, so that you can start placing bets on your favourite teams and players.</p>
<p>What are Esports?</p>
<p>At its core, Esports is simply competitive video gaming. However, over the years it has grown into much more than that. These days, professional gamers compete in tournaments for large sums of money, and the sport has even been featured on ESPN programmes such as SportsCenter.</p>
<p>There are several different genres of Esports, including real-time strategy (RTS), first-person shooters (FPS), multiplayer online battle arena games (MOBA) and battle royale games. Some of the most popular Esports titles include League of Legends, DOTA 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Fortnite and PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG).</p>
<p>How do people bet on Esports?</p>
<p>Just like traditional sports betting, people bet on Esports matches by predicting which team or player will win. The odds are usually available online a few days before the match takes place. Bettors can then use these odds to calculate how much they stand to win if their chosen team or player wins.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to bet on Esports: through bookmakers or exchanges. Bookmakers are websites that accept bets from customers, while exchanges allow punters to bet against each other. Whichever method you choose, make sure you use a reputable site that has a good reputation for paying out winners promptly.</p>

<h1 id="How-much-is-online-gambling-esports-worth"><a href="#How-much-is-online-gambling-esports-worth" class="headerlink" title="How much is online gambling esports worth?"></a>How much is online gambling esports worth?</h1><p>The gambling industry is growing exponentially, and with that growth, more and more opportunities for betting on esports are opening up. So just how much money is at stake in the world of online gambling esports?</p>
<p>To answer that question, it’s important to first look at the overall size of the online gambling industry. In 2017, global online gambling revenue was estimated at $47.5 billion. This number is expected to grow to $59.3 billion by 2020. So although it may be a relatively small portion of the overall gambling market currently, esports betting is definitely growing at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>What’s driving this growth? A big part of it is the increasing popularity of esports itself. The global audience for esports is expected to reach 380 million people by 2020, and that audience is increasingly engaged with betting on the outcomes of matches. Brands are also getting involved; some traditional sports teams like Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain have started their own esport divisions, and major sponsors like Coca-Cola are also investing in the space.</p>
<p>As viewership and interest in esports continues to grow, so too will the amount of money wagered on it. The current estimate for the value of esports gambling globally is $4.5 billion, but that number is expected to grow to $19.5 billion by 2020. That’s a massive increase, and it shows just how important online gambling esports has become in the overall landscape of gambling activity.</p>
