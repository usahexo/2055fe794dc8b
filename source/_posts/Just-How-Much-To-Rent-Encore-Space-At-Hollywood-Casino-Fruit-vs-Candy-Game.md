You love hosting game nights at your place. Your friends are always complementing your level of hospitality and they’ve even started calling you “The Game Master”. Well, it’s time to take your hosting skills to the next level. You’ve decided to rent out an event space for your next game night! But with all the different spaces out there, how do you decide which one is best for you?

One option is to compare the cost of renting an event space vs the cost of buying traditional party supplies like candy and fruit. In this article, we’ll help you make that decision by comparing the average rental prices for different types of event spaces in Toronto.

So let’s get started! The first type of event space we’ll be looking at is a banquet hall. According to our research, the average rental price for a banquet hall in Toronto is $1,700 per event. That’s a lot of money, but it may be worth it if you want a large space that can accommodate a lot of people.

Next up is a nightclub. The average rental price for a nightclub in Toronto is $1,000 per event. This may be a more affordable option if you don’t need as much space as a banquet hall.
