The Saints will need to improve their defense if they want to win the Super Bowl. The good news is that the offense is one of the best in the league. Led by Drew Brees, this unit can put up points in a hurry. The defense will need to keep teams from scoring too many points if the Saints want to hoist the Lombardi Trophy.

Some of the players that will need to play better on defense include Cameron Jordan, Sheldon Rankins, and Marshon Lattimore. These three players will need to make an impact if the Saints want to improve their blackjack game and make a run at the Super Bowl.

Jordan had 10 sacks last season and is one of the best defensive linemen in the league. Rankins had 5 sacks last season and is also a key player on defense. Lattimore had 4 interceptions last season and was named Rookie of the Year. These three players will be crucial to the success of the Saints this season.

#  Blackjack helping the Saints become one of the NFL's best teams

It's been an interesting few years for the New Orleans Saints. After finishing with a 7-9 record in 2014, they made the playoffs in 2015 with an 11-5 mark before losing to the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round. The Saints finished with a ( respectable ) 7-9 record again in 2016, but it was clear that something needed to change if they wanted to return to playoff form.

Enter 2017 and new head coach Sean Payton. With Payton at the helm, the Saints have turned things around, finishing with a ( division-winning ) 11-5 record and making it to the NFC Championship Game before being narrowly defeated by the Rams. While there are many factors that have led to this resurgence, one of the most important has been the team's play at blackjack.

Payton is credited with bringing blackjack strategy to the Saints locker room, and it's quickly become one of the team's most important weapons. By playing smart and making sound bets, the Saints have been able to limit their losses and maximize their gains, giving them a major edge over their opponents.

The numbers don't lie: since adopting blackjack strategy, the Saints are 38-19-1 overall ( a 67% win rate ), including an impressive 14-4 record in 2017. This surge has led many experts to label New Orleans as one of the NFL's elite teams, and there's no doubt that they'll be a force to be reckoned with in next year's playoffs.
